"noduplicates" isn't a valid gds option.
GDS commands have the form ":gds option", where option is one of:
    help		print this help information
    addendum [yes|no]	output only cells that are not type "readonly"
    arrays [yes|no]	output arrays as individual subuses (like in CIF)
    contacts [yes|no]	optimize output by arraying contacts as subcells
    drccheck [yes|no]	mark all cells as needing DRC checking
    flatten [yes|no|limit]	flatten simple cells (e.g., contacts) on input
    ordering [on|off]	cause cells to be read in post-order
    labels [yes|no]	cause labels to be output when writing GDS-II
    library [yes|no]	do not output the top level, only subcells
    lower [yes|no]		allow both upper and lower case in labels
    merge [yes|no]		merge tiles into polygons in the output
    read file		read Calma GDS-II format from "file"
		into edit cell
    readonly [yes|no]	set cell as read-only and generate output from GDS file
    rescale [yes|no]	allow or disallow internal grid subdivision
    warning [option]	set warning information level
    write file		output Calma GDS-II format to "file"
		for the window's root cell
    polygon subcells [yes|no]
		put non-Manhattan polygons into subcells
    path subcells [yes|no]
		put wire paths into individual subcells
If no option is given, a CALMA GDS-II stream file is
    produced for the root cell.
The current CIF output style ("cif ostyle") is used
    to select the mask layers output by :gds write.
The current CIF input style ("cif istyle") is used
    to select the mask layers read by :gds read.
Warning: Calma reading is not undoable!  I hope that's OK.
